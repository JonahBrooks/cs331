*3 file parser (for initial and goal state)
*10 file writer (for solution)
*4 command line parser (for options)

7 node expansion count (for the win) (part of Expand function)
9 solution tracker (for the solution) (Walk up parent nodes from solution)

*6 GraphSearch function (apparently)
*7 Expand function (also apparently)

*8 Priority queue (and FIFO, LIFO, etc) (std::priority_queue, etc)
*5 Hash table (for the close list)

*2 ???
*1 GameState object (comparable, hashable)  <LeftBank[0,0,0],RightBank[0,0,0]>



Read in the initial and goal states; store them somewhere.
Read the mode; switch off this to determine queue type.
Initialize output file.

Call GraphSearch

Print solution.

Done.
